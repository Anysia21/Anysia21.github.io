I am a computer science major at CSFU and I plan on graduating in 2027. 

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

Lab 6, part 2
In this lab we were able to use loops to play a real game of blackjack.  Blackjack is an intricate game which requires vectors and it was cool to see their usage within coding. Making aceâ€™s worth 11 or 1 was a difficult challenge, but calculating the pattern was exciting to figure out. 

Lab 7, part 1
This lab uses in-line arguments to calculate the number of days between two different dates. This lab was fun because I was able to practically use a project that others may find very useful. 
This lab was somewhat difficult because it involved changing strings to integers and using the Fliegel & Van Flandern's algorithm.

Lab 8, part 1
This lab used the concept of Mad-Libs to create a fill in the blank  program that produces a custom sandwich. We used the components of a sandwich from in-line arguments to create a sentence describing an order for that sandwich as output. This was interesting to learn how to create because it relates to other programs like shopping app or cash register software.
